We are very happy that you want to be part of Nuvemshop / Tiendanube 🎉 

This is a short test to understand your **thought process**, how you structure your work and **maximize your time and skills**.

# Say hello to Time travel app 👋

Ever wondered how the world was 200 years ago? What about 2.000? What about 20.000? 

Now people can travel in time and see it for themselves. We invented technology that allows you to travel to any year you want 😱 😱 😱 😱 😱. 


## Now you need to solve the following problem:

The app design has been updated and the service already exists. Now we need to apply the UI of one of the screens of our Web App.

### Implementation details

1. The screen is Mobile Only 📱 ❤️;
2. The design system is only available in figma, so you'll need to deal with component reuse;

# Deliverables

The solution should be delivered as an `html` page and you should email it to us.

- You can use `sass` or even `post css`;
- If you use, don't forget to include the build files (webpack, sass, gulp and etc). 


# Criteria

- Quality in execution 💪 🧠;
- Solid knowledge of HTML vs CSS;
- Ability to simplify. `Simplicity is the ultimate level of sophistication`🙌


Have fun, we want you on the team ❤️
