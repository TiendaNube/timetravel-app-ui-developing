# UI Developer - Time Travel App

We are super happy that you want to be part of our team at Nuvemshop / @Tiendanube!
This is a short test to learn about your thinking process, how you structure your work and how you maximize your time and skills.

# The task
## To develop time travel app.

Ever wondered how the world was 200 years ago? what about 2.000? What about 20.000?
Now people can travel in time and see it for themselves. We invented technology that allows you to travel to any year you want.
The app and service already exist, but because of the lack of a good UX we had several incidents.


## Now you need to solve at least one of the following problems:

1. People are traveling back and talking to themselves creating a time-space paradox. We need to find a way of avoiding this.
2. People are traveling to different times in their regular clothes and driving too much attention to themselves in some periods of time. This caused big troubles and some of our users were injured - which got us pretty bad media coverage. How can we make sure they get there with appropriate clothes?


## Tips!
# The solution can be HUGE and we need to develop and ship this as fast as we can.

Focus your efforts just on the important stuff that could solve the problem and cut scope #MVP!

It's important you present only the flows that solve the problems we mentioned before. The other stuff (like a login) we don’t need it here.
Remember that the main task still is time travel and this should be considered in your design.

Don’t forget about mobile design principles.

# Deliverables

The designed project has to be presented in 6 slides or less using Google Slides, explaining your decisions and showing the product

The solution needs to be designed for mobile and remember that the idea is to incentivize users to travel in time, so be creative and also don’t forget that: the product has to be simple and easy to use.

**Last, but not least: this product also needs to follow the Tiendanube visual identity.**

# Evaluating criteria

Innovation, solution quality, thinking process and concept presentation. We want to see how you think, not just the awesomeness of your designs.


Have fun, we want you on the team!
